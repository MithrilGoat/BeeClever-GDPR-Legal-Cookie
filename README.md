Having to diagnose cookie problems in Shopify themes using the app  
has been such a pain that despite is soon being obsolete - as Shopify  
is adding a ( full ) native consent manager - I still went ahead with  
reversing / documenting it as **they don't have any documentation**.

This is also a rant btw~
