<h1> <kbd> <br> <b>Reverse Enginnering</b> <br><br> of BeeClever's GDPR Legal Cookie Shopify App <br> </kbd> </h1>

<br>

<i>

Having to diagnose cookie problems in Shopify themes using the app  
has been such a pain that despite is soon being obsolete - as Shopify  
is adding a ( full ) native consent manager - I still went ahead with  
reversing / documenting it as **they don't have any documentation**.
